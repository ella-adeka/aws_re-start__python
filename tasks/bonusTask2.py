### Bonus 2:

# This challenge asks you to take a string composed of only lowercase letters and space characters, 
# for example, "_hello world_" and replace every consonant in the string with the next consonant 
# in the alphabet. So in the above example, the output should be "_jemmo xosmf_" and 
# you can see that we left every vowel in place and only changed the consonants.
#  You should notice that the last letter changed was from "d" to "f" and not from "d" to "e" 
# because "e" is a vowel.
